            <h2>FIRM HISTORY</h2>
          </div>

          <div class="history_content">
            <p>
              From 1985 to 1989, Nishith Desai — a globally renowned tax and
              corporate lawyer, author, lecturer, researcher and thought leader
              — made a careful study of law firm management, interviewing over
              100 professional services firm partners and senior leaders. He
              then set up Nishith Desai Associates (NDA) in 1990 as an
              India-centric global law firm specialising in international tax
              and international business strategies. At the time, India was a
              closed country, so he expanded his practice to the US with a
              special focus on India.<br />
              Soon thereafter, India introduced its first dose of liberalisation
              in 1991. NDA was in the right place at the right time and brought
              fresh ideas from its global experience to India. It pioneered the
              Asset Management (i.e., Fund Formation) practice and brought the
              first five funds to India, which were sponsored by Barclays de
              zotte wedd management, Alliance Capital, GeorgeSoros and Chase
              Capital, AIG/ILFS and Walden. Soon, the practice expanded to
              corporate, IP and cross-border litigation and dispute resolution.
              NDA quickly became one of the top law firms working in the
              international arena.

            Soon thereafter, India introduced its first dose of liberalisation
            in 1991. NDA was in the right place at the right time and brought
            fresh ideas from its global experience to India. It pioneered the
            Asset Management (i.e., Fund Formation) practice and brought the
            first five funds to India, which were sponsored by Barclays de zotte
            wedd management, Alliance Capital, GeorgeSoros and Chase Capital,
            AIG/ILFS and Walden. Soon, the practice expanded to corporate, IP
            and cross-border litigation and dispute resolution. NDA quickly
            became one of the top law firms working in the international arena.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2000, the firm was named Indian Law Firm of the Year; in 2001,
            Asian Law Firm of the Year (Pro bono); and later, a series of
            accolades followed. At the same time, NDA’s interest in social
            responsibility and impact started intensifying. In 2010, Nishith
            Desai and his son Suril Desai were awarded the Nobel Laureate Prof.
            Mohd Yunus Social Business Pioneer Award. More recently, NDA has
            been nominated for the Thomson Reuters TrustLaw Award for the firm’s
            contribution to developing the regulatory regime for Impact
            Investing in India.
          </p>
          <p>
            As time progressed, NDA’s focus steered towards Innovation, using a
            concerted program of original research to find solutions to complex
            problems. In 2014, Financial Times announced The Most Innovative Law
            Firm Awards in Asia for the first time. NDA was right there. For the
            first six years in a row until 2019, NDA won the most innovative law
            firm title every year.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2020, the firm stopped participating in the award as it paused to
            reinvent itself as the most technologically advanced virtual law
            firm.
          </p>
          <p>
            When NDA won The Most Innovative Law firm in Asia Award, Financial
            Times wrote: “Ahead of the curve, Nishith Desai Associates, an
            Indian law firm, adopted its industry focus, or “vertical” approach
            to sectors, in the mid-1990s, well before many UK firms. With only
            75 professionals, NDA tops the FT’s ranking of firms headquartered
            in the Asia-Pacific region this year. One reason it punches above
            its weight is because it invests half its annual profits in research
            and development. Their competitors tend to use their profit pools to
            pay partners.”
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result of this willingness to reinvest in the firm, innovation
            has become the DNA of NDA. The firm has assiduously built a culture
            of creativity and problem solving.
          </p>
          <p>
            NDA’s practice has since been expanded into various areas while it
            continues to stay focused on financial services, TMT and Pharma
            Healthcare and their sub segments.
